About me

I'm *Jordy* a full stack developer who lives in Fortaleza (Brazil) and I **love** to code, to learn about technology and to help other people, so if your reading this I hope this project helps you in someway.

This is one my first projects using *ReactJS* and *Typescript* and I'm very excited to show what I'm learning from this week of challenges.

Please follow me for more codes!
